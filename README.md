# The WeatherPy repository contain the deliverables for the Module 6 Challenge

# Deliverable 1 

    1.  Coordinates were derived by generating 2000 random lat-lng pairs for locations across the world. 
    2.  Lat-lng pairs correspond to worldwide ocean and city locations.
    3.  Used these lat-lng pairs along with the OpenWeatherMapy API to retrieve weather information from cities across the world. 
    4.  The resulting cities, along with their corresponding countries, lat-lng values, max-temp, humidity, cloudiness, wind speed, and current weather conditions were output to a DataFrame and saved to a CSV file.
    5.  Deliverable 1 includes the Weather_Database.ipynb file and the WeatherPy_Database.csv file containing the DataFrame.

# Deliverable 2 

    1.  A Google Maps API was used to retrieve cities within a maximum temperature range from 60-90 degrees F. 
    2.  For each city, a hotel within 5000 meters of the lat-lng position was included, along with the weather parameters from Deliverable 1 to make a new DataFrame for the cities included in the input temperature range. 
    3.  A global map was generated with markers for each city and pop-ups that show the hotel name, city, county, current weather condition and max temps.
    4.  Deliverable 2 includes the Vacation_Search.ipynb file, the WeatherPy_vacation.csv file, and the WeatherPy_vacation_map.png image.

# Deliverable 3

    1.  Google Directions API was used to create a travel iterary map that shows the routes between four South African cities.
    2.  A map showing pop-up markers for the four South African cities was also constructed.
    3.  Diverable 3 includes the Vacation_Itinerary.ipynb file, the WeatherPy_travel_map.png image, and the WeatherPy_travel_map_markers.png image.
